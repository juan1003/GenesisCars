<p>
    GenesisCars is an experimental prototype created to help the Genesis Cars dealership explore new ideas for
    managing inventory, customers, and operational insights. The application is not a production system and should
    be used exclusively for evaluation and testing purposes.
</p>

<h2 class="h5">How We Use Data</h2>
<p>
    Any information entered into the platform is treated as test data. Team members should only provide synthetic
    or sample content that supports experimentation. We do not collect, analyze, or share the information beyond
    the scope of validating the prototype's functionality.
</p>

<h2 class="h5">User Accounts</h2>
<p>
    User credentials exist solely to let participants access the application during the experiment. Account
    details are not repurposed for marketing, analytics, or any other business process, and they will be removed
    once the experiment concludes.
</p>

<h2 class="h5">Questions</h2>

    team before entering additional information.
